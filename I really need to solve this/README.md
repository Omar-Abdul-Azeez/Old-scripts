# The puzzle
In the vast universe of planetary modulo there exists many different planets with many different modulus (we'll call the mod n)

each planet has a **BIG** ~OLED FULLHD~ TV screen with a number on it (that number = itself mod n aka positive and less than n)

BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!!! EACH PLANET COUNTS EITHER ALWAYS UP OR ALWAYS DOWN EACH SECOND (and you have that info beforehand... ugh planets just can't keep global secrets)

THE QUESTION IS! WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE GREAT APOCALYPSE OF SYNCHRONIZATION FALL UPON THESE LITTLE CREATURES??? (aka at what number and after how many seconds will the screens show the same number

NO BRUTE FORCING... MAY ALL BRUTE FORCERS FOREVER BE IN SYNC


PS: I don't know which was the question about so if your solution can find them seperately then do so (also if finding one is easier or faster than the other)
